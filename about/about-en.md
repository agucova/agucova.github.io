## About me
I'm a 17 year old student with a great deal of love for computing and science

At 10, I started programming in multiple languages, with the first being LUA to then move on to some basic web development, afterwards I started making mods and plugins for videogame [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).
After a while, I gained interest in the cybersecurity field, where I started being an active member of ["Seguridad Inform√°tica Chile"](https://hacking.cl). Nowadays I have a lot of an interest in various fields of science, ranging from psychology to medicine, although I'm starting to think about studying biomedical engineering or bioinformatics.

I'm also part of [Frente Conocimiento](https://frenteconocimiento.cl), an organization that formed after organizing [Chile's March for Science](https://marchaporlaciencia.cl) satellite, both in 2017 and 2018.

You can find my frequenting my [Github](https://github.com/agucova), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/agucova) and perhaps one day, my [Blog](https://agucova.github.io/posts/). (Tweet me!)
