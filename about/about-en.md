## About me
I'm an 19 year old student and activist with a great deal of love for computing and science.

At 10 I started programming in multiple languages, my first being LUA, to then start programming in Java for the development of mods and plugins for the videogame Minecraft. After a while, I gained interest in the cybersecurity field, where I started being an active member of ["Seguridad Inform√°tica Chile"](https://hacking.cl). Today I program mainly in Python, while ocassionaly working on lower-level languages such as C, but my main interest has shifted from computing towards biomedical engineering in general.

Since 2017 I've been an organizer of the [chilean satellite](https://marchaporlaciencia.cl/) of [March for Science](https://marchforscience.com/) a global scientific activism movement targeting evidence-based policy and science advocacy, among other things. From there I cofounded [Frente Conocimiento](https://frenteconocimiento.cl), a group of chilean scientific institutions that has organized the march yearly since then.

You can find my frequenting my [Github](https://github.com/agucova), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/austinc3301) and perhaps one day, my [Blog](https://agucova.github.io/posts/). (Tweet me!)
