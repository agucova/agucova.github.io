## About me
I'm an 18 year old student with a great deal of love for computing and science.

At 10, I started programming in multiple languages, with the first being LUA to then move on to some basic web development. Later I started making mods and plugins (in Java) for the videogame [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).

After a while, I gained interest in the cybersecurity field, where I started being an active member of ["Seguridad Inform√°tica Chile"](https://hacking.cl). Nowadays I have a lot of an interest in various fields of science, ranging from psychology to medicine, although my main interest is biomedical engineering.

Since 2017 I've been an organizer of the [chilean satellite](https://marchaporlaciencia.cl/) of [March for Science](https://marchforscience.com/) a global scientific activism movement targeting evidence-based policy and science advocacy, among other things. From there I cofounded Frente Conocimiento, a group of chilean scientific institutions that has organized the march yearly since then.

You can find my frequenting my [Github](https://github.com/agucova), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/austinc3301) and perhaps one day, my [Blog](https://agucova.github.io/posts/). (Tweet me!)
